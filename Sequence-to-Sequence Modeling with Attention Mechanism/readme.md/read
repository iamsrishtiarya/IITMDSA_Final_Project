# Seq2Seq Model with Attention Mechanism

This project implements a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an attention mechanism for sequence transformation tasks using PyTorch. The model is trained on synthetic data and evaluates performance in reversing sequences. 

## Features
- **Seq2Seq Architecture**: Includes Encoder, Attention, and Decoder components.  
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enables better handling of long input sequences by focusing on relevant parts.  
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Automatically generates source and target sequences for training.  
- **Training and Testing**: Includes scripts for training the model and evaluating accuracy.  
- **Visualization**: Plots the training loss curve for monitoring progress.  
- **Modular Design**: Organized with separate files and folders for models, utilities, and data.
